        <header><h1>The Scarlet Ibis Essay<br>by Max Greer<h1></header>
        <p>People say that blood is thicker than water but is pride thicker than both?  In the dramatic short story, “The Scarlet Ibis” by James Hurst, is about two brothers. The story tells of how the oldest brother manipulates his younger brother Doodle, and in time is responsible for his brothers death. These actions show that he did not truly love his brother.</p>
        <p>The oldest brother was egotistical throughout the story. Pride was the only reason he helped Doodle. He was humiliated to have a five-year-old brother that couldn't walk. So in his free time, he taught this brother to walk. Not to make Doodle feel better but to make himself feel better. The pride of the eldest brother made him push Doodle to hard. The eldest brother wanted a normal brother so the pushed Doodle as if he were that ‘Normal’. But Doodle physically could not handle activities like swimming and running because of his weak heart. The narrator's persistent brought a tragic end to Doodle's life.</p>
        <p>The narrator’s judgment was heavily clouded by his pride. His pride abolished his ability to reason with Doodle. The narrator couldn’t grasp the effects that his persistents was having on his brother the warped view that the narrator's pride gave him made it seem that the did not care for his brother at certain parts of the story. The pride of the eldest brother made him only care about himself and how the felt and made him blind to the needs of his brother. The eldest brother forgot that he was responsible for his brother Doodle.</p>
        <p>The eldest brother's pride changed the way he saw Doodle. Granted Doodle might have been happier if he could walk, run, swim, and jump. But the way it was directed was beneficial for one brother and catastrophic to the other. </p>
